ðŸ”‘ Key Features:

Image Encryption: Transform images by altering pixel values, making them secure and unrecognizable.
For example, encrypting an original red butterfly picture turns it into green.

Image Decryption: Restore the original image by reversing the encryption process.
The decryption of the green butterfly image brings back the red butterfly.
Interestingly, decrypting the original red butterfly picture turns it into blue, showcasing a unique transformation effect.

This project not only showcases the fundamental concepts of image processing and encryption but also emphasizes the importance of data security in our digital world.
